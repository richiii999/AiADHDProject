One critical aspect of reducing distractions is establishing clear goals and priorities [1].

Furthermore, incorporating regular breaks can help recharge energy levels and minimize feelings of overwhelm.

Paying attention to the material presented in the course or textbook allows students to better grasp complex concepts, leading to improved retention and reduced mind-wandering [4].
