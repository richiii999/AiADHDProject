Based on the provided study session history, I've analyzed the data to identify patterns and trends. It appears that the student tends to get distracted during long study sessions (> 2 hours) and is more focused during shorter sessions (< 1 hour). Additionally, it seems that breaks every 45-60 minutes help maintain focus.

To reduce distractions, I recommend implementing a Pomodoro timer with regular 5-minute breaks. This can be done using an app or a physical timer. During these breaks, the student can stretch, move around, and refresh their mind.
