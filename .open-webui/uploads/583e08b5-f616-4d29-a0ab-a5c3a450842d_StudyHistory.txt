START SUMMARY

The student's 60-minute study session on Organizational Behavior can be summarized as follows:

* The study session lasted for 60 minutes, during which time the student's focus fluctuated.
* Initially, from Time = 5 minutes to Time = 20 minutes, the student was focused, as indicated by both FaceTracker and GazeTracker.
* However, around Time = 20-30 minutes, the student became distracted, with FaceTracker detecting distraction and GazeTracker still indicating focus. This period of distraction persisted until around Time = 40 minutes, whereupon the student took a break (which I suggested).
* After the break, the student regained their focus, as seen from Time = 50 minutes to the end of the session at Time = 60 minutes. Both FaceTracker and GazeTracker consistently reported the user was focused during this latter portion of the study session.
* No quiz results were available for this study session.

The suggested actions to reduce distraction included implementing the STOP strategy [2] when the student feels themselves getting distracted, as well as taking regular breaks (like the one suggested around Time = 40 minutes) to recharge and refocus.
