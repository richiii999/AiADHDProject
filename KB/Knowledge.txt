I've reviewed the provided context, which includes a history of study sessions by the student. To better understand the effectiveness of different approaches in reducing distractions, I'll analyze the study session history.

From my analysis, I found that there is an overall trend of improved focus during study sessions where the student:

* Set specific goals and priorities [1]
* Created a conducive study environment, minimizing external distractions
* Took regular breaks to recharge and refocus

Conversely, instances where the student struggled with distractions often occurred when they:

* Tried to multitask or switch between multiple tasks simultaneously
* Had excessive social media usage or engaging in conversations during study sessions

Based on this analysis, it appears that setting clear goals, minimizing external distractions, and taking regular breaks are effective actions in reducing distractions. On the other hand, trying to multitask or engaging in excessive social media usage seem to be less effective strategies.

Please let me know if you have any specific questions or areas you'd like me to expand upon.
