  <answer>Yes, to effectively reduce distractions during study sessions, students can use the Pomodoro Technique, which involves working in focused 25-minute increments, followed by a five-minute break [1]. This technique helps maintain focus and reduces mind-wandering, leading to better retention of material. Additionally, students can utilize website blockers or app restrictions on non-essential websites during study sessions [2], or implement a "no new email" rule for a set period before starting study time [3]. By incorporating these strategies into their study routine, students can improve their ability to concentrate and stay on task, leading to improved academic performance.</answer>
